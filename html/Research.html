          <h2>Home page</h2>
          <div class="row">

          <p>The research for the home page was done through youtube. In the original owners webpage the things he did was add <br>
            a scroll nav bar whichwas particulary intesesting and it had been taken as a refrence. The over layout is similar <br>
            to the the original page.

          <h2>About me</h2>

           </div>
           <p>
             The research for the about me page was done through youtube and an example of an templete. In the original owners pages <br>
             how they aligned the different sections were new. The sections were well aligned and how a progress bar was also placed <br>
             to show the owners capabilities and his own expriences as well.
           </p>

          <h2>Blog</h2>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="coloumn">
           <img src="../images/Research/research3.jpeg" width="75%">
           </div>
           <div class="coloumn">
           <img src="../images/Research/sc3.png" width="75%" height="95%" >
           </div>
           <p>
             The research for the Blog page was done through youtube. In the owners orininal page the way the borders were put were <br> 
             different than other blogs. It was quite simple and not too much time consuming to learn the different tags and their <br>
             from this owner. In the owners page he used many divison tags to seperate the different variables to not get mixed up <br>
             with each other. In the css part he had put borders in only some parts to make it look good.

          <h2>Contact</h2>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="coloumn">

           </div>
           <p>
             And lastly for the contact us page it was also done through youtube. For above webages everytime different vidoes were <br>
             taken as refrence. The contact page seemes quite simliar to the originl owners'. The video taught how to apply labels <br>
             that would help the end user to ask queries that could be responded through email or phone no. The contact us page was <br>
             simply made to answer any queries from he consumer who had difficulty to understand the information provided.
