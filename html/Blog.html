                <h2>What is Technology?</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Any application that is built or constructed using applied science/math to solve a problem in society is referred to as technology.
                    Agricultural technology, such as those used by ancient civilizations, or computing technology used more recently are examples of this.
                    Technology can include both ancient and modern technologies, such as the calculator, compass, calendar, battery, ships, and chariots.
                    Advanced Blockchain technologies, smart cities, more sophisticated smart devices, quantum computers, quantum encryption, and advanced 
                    Artificial Intelligence are all examples of future technology.
                </p>

                <h2>What is a Society?</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Any organized group of people living together in a community, which frequently includes some type of government/governance, as well as laws, roles, and an economy, is referred to as a society. In ancient times, the latter generally included an agricultural economy as well as imports and exports, as well as militaries and educational institutions, and eventually evolved into advanced kingdoms.

                <h2>Effect of Technology on our daily life</h2>
                <h3>Lifestyle</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    If there was a single word to describe the modern lifestyle, it would have to be "convenience." 
                </p>
                <p>
                    From purchasing online from the comfort of one's sofa and having things delivered the next day to the appropriate doorstep,
                    to joining friends for a meetup via a social app without having to leave the house, to booking a flight and lodging across the world for travel the next day, tablet computers and wearable computers are becoming increasingly popular.
                </p>
                <hr>

                <h3>Privacy</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    When it comes to the subject of privacy, technology has a tainted background. Most individuals believe that cameras, intrusive apps, smart technologies (such as smart homes and Alexa), and spy gadgets have helped to endanger the privacy of a growing number of people. While this is somewhat true, technology has also improved end-users' capacity to have encrypted web sessions and send encrypted messages.
                </p>

                <h3>Attitudes of the Youth </h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The rise of technology has traditionally had the greatest impact on younger generations. While earlier generations may have grown up using technology for particular, vital functions like email, millennials and generation Z utilize technology for nearly every task and are frequently overexposed to EMFs and blue light.
                    This includes, for example, the use of tablets in school, web gateways to finish homework, and YouTube to learn a language, all of which are in stark contrast to how the preceding generation studied. Because of their increased reliance on technology, the younger generation is less concerned about the privacy issues that come with it. <br>
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    Simultaneously, younger generations are more likely to have a better understanding of how the Internet and technological systems work, potentially filling a significant need in companies that require technical staff.
                </p>

                <h3>Human Behaviour</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Human behavior is as mysterious as it is complex, but as sociologists and anthropologists analyze human behavior in the context of society, it is obvious that technology has aided in the shaping and evolution of human behavior as the human species continues to rely on technology on a daily basis.
                    As animals of comfort, the ease of use and convenience that technology affords necessitates a constant adoption of smartphones, social media, and Internet-connected devices, with WiFi hotspots becoming a need in practically every hospitality company.
